This blog webapp utilizes the technologies:  
-Ruby on Rails obviously
-Devise for user, session, and password management
-Bootstrap to make things look pretty since I'm no css wizard.
-Rspec and Capybara for quick automated testing
-Heroku for hosting online as well as the New Relic addon to stop the dyno from idling

Obligatory shoutouts to:
  Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl which is a fantastic resource and where I've learned practically everything I know about Rails (and some extra). I definitely owe him a beer(beer-ware license.)
  Railscasts by Ryan Bates for brutally thorough screencasts on anything and everything you would want to know about Rails.
